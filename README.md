# Size Selector Enhancement for Shopify
This script hides the default size variant selection and replaces it with a custom size selector that allows users to toggle between UK, EU, and US sizes.

üöÄ **Shopify Size Switcher** is a lightweight JavaScript solution that allows users to **toggle between UK, EU, and US size formats** on Shopify product pages. It works with **both numeric and text-based sizes**, preventing layout flash issues.

## üìå Feature List & How It Works
- ‚úÖ 1. Dynamic Size Format Switching
    Allows users to toggle between UK, EU, and US size formats.
    Works with both numeric and text-based sizes (e.g., UK 10 | EU 44 | US 11 and UK Small | EU Medium | US Large).
    Updates size labels dynamically on click.
- ‚úÖ 2. Automatic Size Detection
    Extracts sizes from a predefined format UK [size] | EU [size] | US [size].
    Uses a robust regex pattern to capture both numeric & text-based values.
    Products with size variants format not found ‚Üí Works as usual (no interference).
    Products with mixed formats (some missing sizes) ‚Üí Shows "N/A" only where needed, otherwise retains original size.
- ‚úÖ 3. Prevents "Flashing" of Old Sizes
    Hides the size fieldset initially (display: none) to prevent a flash of old sizes before JavaScript updates them.
- ‚úÖ 4. SEO & Accessibility Friendly
    Optimized for Shopify's themes like Dawn & Debut.
    Ensures semantic HTML structure for search engines.
    Does not break Shopify's built-in variant selection system.
- ‚úÖ 5. Works with All Shopify Themes
    Customizable selector paths make it adaptable for any Shopify theme.
    Works for both classic and modern Shopify structures.
- ‚úÖ 6. SEO & Performance Optimized for faster page loads.
- ‚úÖ 7. No Shopify App Required ‚Äì Works with native Shopify variant system.
